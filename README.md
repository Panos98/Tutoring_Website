# Tutoring_Website
I decided to address a need in our school community for a comprehensive platform to coordinate math tutoring. Having some degree of programming knowledge, I am using my newfound knowledge in PHP to code and program a website and web app for the school's math department. It is still in development - so far the login script has been made (all the files are shown above) 

An algorithm which determines which students in their specific time frames can connect to to tutors within their availibility is being integrated into website.
